INTRODUCTION

1.1	PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Paper consumption is the superlative reason for forest degradation and notice is an indispensable requirement for public places, organization to get connect or communicate with people in one way or both. Since there are many easy configurable, low power consuming wireless technologies (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RF, XBEE, GSM) are available, a wireless electronic notice board system can be easily realized by using any of them replacing the need of paper notice board. Since the world is stepping towards digitization the need for wireless digital notice board is found. Wireless e-notice board is a perfect replacement of paper notice board providing easy maintenance, portability and access. 

1.2	PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
The wired communication faces a lot of shortcomings such as need of hard wiring, BER (bit error rate) at high transmission speed due to wire line capacitance, high cost, high maintenance and short coverage. Wireless communication systems have made a significant move to overcome such problems. Bluetooth, RF, Xbee, WI - Fi and GSM, are easily available wireless technologies suitable for short, medium and long range wireless communication. A method of updating digital notice board through BLUETOOTH via Android application is described. It emphasizes the method of transmitting a notice in the form of Application via mobile and receiving that message by microcontroller through BLUETOOTH module hardware and displaying the received message. Since it uses the BLUETOOTH as wireless mediator .  Bluetooth based wireless electronic notice board prototype approach is described.
1.3	LITERATURE SURVEY:
In present state this system lacks software,time consumed in accessing the  message,manual creation,traditional boards which complex the system by  wires and there is no automatic criteria.But after implementation it comes with wireless,android app control,easy to use and automatic operation without any delay .Manual operation by the person by sticking various notices is difficult in day to day life. This project deals with advanced hi-tech technology to save the time energy and finally environment.
