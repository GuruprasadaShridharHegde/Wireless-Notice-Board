# Wireless-Notice-Board
Sending messages wirelessly and read notifications of your mobile instantly..

INTRODUCTION

1.1	PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Paper consumption is the superlative reason for forest degradation and notice is an indispensable requirement for public places, organization to get connect or communicate with people in one way or both. Since there are many easy configurable, low power consuming wireless technologies (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RF, XBEE, GSM) are available, a wireless electronic notice board system can be easily realized by using any of them replacing the need of paper notice board. Since the world is stepping towards digitization the need for wireless digital notice board is found. Wireless e-notice board is a perfect replacement of paper notice board providing easy maintenance, portability and access. 

1.2	PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
The wired communication faces a lot of shortcomings such as need of hard wiring, BER (bit error rate) at high transmission speed due to wire line capacitance, high cost, high maintenance and short coverage. Wireless communication systems have made a significant move to overcome such problems. Bluetooth, RF, Xbee, WI - Fi and GSM, are easily available wireless technologies suitable for short, medium and long range wireless communication. A method of updating digital notice board through BLUETOOTH via Android application is described. It emphasizes the method of transmitting a notice in the form of Application via mobile and receiving that message by microcontroller through BLUETOOTH module hardware and displaying the received message. Since it uses the BLUETOOTH as wireless mediator .  Bluetooth based wireless electronic notice board prototype approach is described.
1.3	LITERATURE SURVEY:
In present state this system lacks software,time consumed in accessing the  message,manual creation,traditional boards which complex the system by  wires and there is no automatic criteria.But after implementation it comes with wireless,android app control,easy to use and automatic operation without any delay .Manual operation by the person by sticking various notices is difficult in day to day life. This project deals with advanced hi-tech technology to save the time energy and finally environment.
1.4	SIGNIFICANCE:
The system is comprised of both software and hardware. Software area includes the Bluetooth android application development and code algorithm for microcontroller to receive and display a notice on Dot Matrix display. The hardware area includes the development of receiver hardware using ATmega32 microcontroller and its configuration with both modules.  The developed system reflects the minimum requirements to realize the wireless notice board. The system has the following sections-
A.	Bluetooth Communication
B.	Bluetooth Module and Connection
C.	System Integration
D.	Arduino interfacing to Dot Matrix Display

1.5	SCOPE:
It is not like traditional system.The developed system reflects the minimum requirements to realize the wireless notice board.Notice boards are extensively used in daily life .It plays the major role in public places,organizations etc.This modern proposed solution used for many applications .Wireless and android control gives easy user interface with minimum complexities.Bluetooth technology which enhances the security and DMD dispay having higher accuracy with low power consumption.This system will not introduces delay during operation.

1.6	ABOUT THE PROJECT:
We have been using notice boards to display messages in offices, schools hospitals etc. from a long time. But the major problem with these notice boards are every time we need to change the message we have to go there and then erase previous message and then write the new one. So this project is a solution to this problem as it wireless technology Bluetooth which provides us the facility to change message on notice boards from distant mobile phone that is operated on android OS to do the same a application is built with the graphical interface to change the message.
Fully android control gives the user to multi functionalities like speech to text,all sensor readings,terminal,mobile notifications like SMS,facebook or whatsapp and also mobile battery percentage.It is one of the real time application used in different fields.
